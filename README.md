A repo to hold pre-work study guide things


# Prework study AWESOMENESS and NOTES! WEBPAGE

## Description

My motivation behind this webpage was to help gain an understanding of the "basics" that programming has to offer. Taking on all these big slices is a pretty taxing thing, but I hope to overcome as much as I can!

I also built this project to help ideate on things that I learn throughout this pre-work but also to give me some clarity on what to somewhat expect!

I've learned that coding won't be simple, but I know that it will be eventful and interesting!

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This study guide allows me to notate any and all information I find relevant to the expansion of knowledge within this course! 

I can continue to evolve the code that lives on this webpage and integrate more and more that I learn and use this as my exercise!
